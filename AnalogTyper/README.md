
A demo of typing with the Zeemote JS1 controller, a small hand held controller with a thumb stick.

Press the analog stick left, right, up, or down to pick the group of characters that contains the one you want to type. That group will then be highlighted:

Then press the analog stick again to choose the character to type. There will be a character left, right, up, down, and in the corners.

This could eventually be turned into an input method for Android and then used to type into any program.
